# Object Type (Quirk)

The `object` type is when you have no way of knowing
what an object is ahead of time.

If you've used Flow, don't be confused by this. This is not
the weak `Object` type (which is now just an alias for `any`).
It is closer to the empty object `{}`, and any property accesses
will result in an error.

```tsx
const getEnabled = (data: object) => {
  data.enabled; // error
  if ("enabled" in data) {
    return data.enabled; // still an error
  }
};
```

```tsx
// Example: You don't know what the properties of an object
// are, but you know which ones you care about.
// This one's easy: see excess-property-checking.ts
const getEnabled = (data: { enabled?: boolean }) => {
  return !!data.enabled;
};
const data1 = { enabled: true, name: "test1" };
const data2 = { name: "test1" };
getEnabled(data1);
getEnabled(data2);
```
