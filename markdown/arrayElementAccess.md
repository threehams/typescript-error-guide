# Unsafe Array Access (Limitation)

In this example

```tsx
const array = [0, 1];
array[0];
array[1];
array[2]; // hey! this should be an error!
```

but just like objects are mutable in TS, so are arrays.
Imagine this case:

```tsx
const pushToArray = <T extends any>(arr: T[], element: T): T[] => {
  arr.push(element);
  return arr;
};

const arr = [0, 1];
pushToArray(arr, 2); // now arr[2] exists
arr[2]; // if TS showed an error here, it would be extremely annoying
```

TypeScript would have to do a lot more work to analyze your code to figure
out safe array access - and it's just not a common enough case to be worth
the cost.

However, tuple types exist, which have a known length that can never change.
Checking access on these is cheap, so use `as const` to change from number[]
(array of numbers of any length) to [number, number] (array of numbers with
a length of 2).
(you'll see the term "const context" floating around: it means "immutable")

```tsx
const tuple = [0, 1] as const;

tuple[0];
tuple[1];
tuple[2]; // correctly an error
```
